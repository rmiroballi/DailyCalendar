# DailyCalendar
A daily calendar used for the Raspberry Pi wall calendar.

This will display a weekly calendar with the current day on the left, with the rest of the week to the right. It will automatically refresh every hour.

You will need to go to your calendar setup in google calendars to generate the embedded URL.
